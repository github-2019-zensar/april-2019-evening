Here are some instructions
Be very careful when using this command because it will add all the changed files to your commit which you may not want in many cases.
You can add individual files to the stging area by using git add. For example git add file1.js image.png index.php to add only "file1.js",

"image.png" and "index.php" to the staging area and then you can create a commit with git commit -m "your commit message".

Please read all the instructions carefully before using this file
